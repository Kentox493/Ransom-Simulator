# Ransomware Simulator with RSA ðŸš¨

## Project Description

This project is a **ransomware simulator** that uses **RSA algorithm** to encrypt and decrypt files. The application simulates how ransomware works, where the victim's files are encrypted using RSA encryption, and the private RSA key is used to decrypt the encrypted files.

The program also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **PyQt5**, featuring **matrix animation effects** (like those seen in hacker movies) and easy-to-use features for encrypting and decrypting files.

### Key Features
- **File Encryption & Decryption**: Uses RSA to encrypt and decrypt files.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with **PyQt5** for a user-friendly experience.
- **Matrix Animation Effect**: Green binary text flowing on a black background, simulating a hacker's screen.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays progress during encryption and decryption.
- **Ransomware Pop-up**: After encryption, a pop-up simulates ransomware, asking for a private key to decrypt the files.
