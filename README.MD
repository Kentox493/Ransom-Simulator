# Ransomware Simulator with RSA ðŸš¨

## Project Description

This project is a **ransomware simulator** that uses **RSA algorithm** to encrypt and decrypt files. The application simulates how ransomware works, where the victim's files are encrypted using RSA encryption, and the private RSA key is used to decrypt the encrypted files.

The program also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **PyQt5**, featuring **matrix animation effects** (like those seen in hacker movies) and easy-to-use features for encrypting and decrypting files.

### Key Features
- **File Encryption & Decryption**: Uses RSA-4096 bits to encrypt and decrypt files.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with **PyQt5** for a user-friendly experience.
